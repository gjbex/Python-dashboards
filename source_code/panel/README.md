# panel

panel is a framework for Python that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text. It's built on top of Bokeh, a Python interactive visualization library, and makes it easy to create interactive web apps, dashboards, and data applications.
