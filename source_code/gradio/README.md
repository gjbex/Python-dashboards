# Gradio

Gradio is a framework for creating GUIs for Python scripts or
notebooks in very few lines of code.  It is mainly intended
for use in machine learning projects.  The GUI is presented in
a web browser.


## What is it?

1. `hello_world.py`: Python script that implements a hello world
   application.
1. `hello_world.ipynb`: Python notebook that implements a hello world
   application.  For notebooks, the GUI is embedded in the notebook
   itsel.
1. `chat.py`: Python script that implements a "chat bot" that replies
   with "yes" or "no" randomly.
1. `environment.yml`: definition of a conda environment to run gradio
   applications.
