Dashbaords are a useful tool to present data for reporting and exploration.
The added value is that a dashboard can be interactive.  Python has several
frameworks to easily create dashboards, and you will learn about their
relative strengths and weaknesses based on some real-world use cases.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * be able to create simple dashboards for reporting purposes;
  * be able to create simple web applications;
  * learn how to deploy dashboards on Github;
  * learn how to deploy web application on streamlit.io;
  * learn how to deploy a web application on Amazon EC2;
  * know which libraries and frameworks to choose depending
    on your project requirements.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-dashboards,
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python for data analysis.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.  Familiarity with pandas is not required, but would be beneficial.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
